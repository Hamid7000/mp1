              <p>A music artist creates, performs, and releases music either independently or through a record label. The commitment level of a music artist is extreme, living sometimes a nomadic and taxing lifestyle and spending long days and nights in the studio recording music. They travel constantly, performing their music to small and large audiences with the goal of expanding their fan base.

                Being a music artist requires a lot of talent, skill, and knowledge. Talent alone is not enough, but must be coupled with continual studying, learning and practicing.

              <p>Kaifi was born and raised in Karachi's neighborhood of Lyari to a family of Baloch musicians.[8] He lived a relatively troubled childhood with financial troubles after his father died, and frequently skipped school.[9]

                In 2015, he started his own YouTube channel and uploaded his first video in 2016. His first song was a cover of “Mani Tawe Dost,” a Balochi tune.[10]
                
                He used to upload covers of songs and original music by him on his YouTube channel before being discovered in 2022 by Coke Studio's music producer, Xulfi. He wrote and composed his verse in "Kana Yaari" three years prior to releasing it on the Coke Studio platform, singing alongside artists Eva B and Abdul Wahab Bugti.[11][12]
                
                Since its release in 2022, his Urdu language song "Kahani Suno 2.0" continues to be the top song for Spotify charts in Pakistan with 350 million plus streams to date. It also topped charts in Bangladesh and became a trending song in neighbouring India. The song's top countries for listeners include India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the UK, USA and Canada.[13]
                
                Its music video also secured a spot in YouTube's Top 10 Global Charts peaking at number 8, the first Pakistani music video to do so.[14][15] It is also listed among the most-viewed Pakistani YouTube videos.
                
                In 2023, he announced his first international tour in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[16]
                
                He has a vast discography with multiple songs, including Dilbar Dila Bide, Afsos, Beqaraar, Jungle Jungle, Tauba Tauba, Drog and Kadi Kaye.[17]
                
                Other singles released by Kaifi include Baali Guraab (2021), Kadi Kaye (2021) and Mast (2022)</p>

              <p>Justin Drew Bieber (/biːbər/ BEE-bər; born March 1, 1994)[1][2] is a Canadian singer. Bieber is recognized for his genre-melding musicianship and global influence in modern-day popular music.[3] He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP My World (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.

                Bieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album My World 2.0 (2010), which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[4] The album spawned the internationally successful single "Baby" (featuring Ludacris), which became one of the best selling singles of all time in the US.[5] His second studio album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US.[6] Bieber experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, Believe (2012), and went on to become the first artist in history with five US number-one albums by the age of 18.[7] From 2013–14, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a drastic impact on his public image.[8]
